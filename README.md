### Requirements:

- iPhone

### Built with:

### Installing:

To download this app, go to the app store and download the application. User registration will be required in order to begin or start a hunt. At the time, this app is only supported on iOS devices.

### What is SEEK_R?

SEEK_R is an iOS application where users can create a 'scavenger hunt' for other users to accept and complete. It is similar to geocaching, but it is directed towards private groups rather than the public. 

The app includes a local board based on location that display a list of hunts created by users. One user can accept the hunt and then follow the gps coordinates provided by the creator. A messaging system will be created for the two users to connect with each other for hints or completion confirmation. Upon completion of a hunt, the seeker will provide a rating for the hider based on difficulty and coolness of location.

### Backend

SEEK_R is backed by a Ruby/Rails server that utilizes postgres to store user information, along with messages between users. Here is the repo: https://github.com/travispbuckley/seek_r-backend
